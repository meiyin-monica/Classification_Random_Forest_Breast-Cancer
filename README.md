The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset is used to diagnose breast cancer based on cell characteristics taken from fine needle aspiration images. The number of samples in this dataset is 569 and 31 columns. Each feature is calculated in three forms, namely average, standard error (SE), and worst value.  I'm using The dataset from this link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic

# GOALS:
1. Classifying cancer into 2, namely malignant and benign
2. Predict the numerical value of a particular feature based on existing data.
3. predict the probability of each label

# Insights:
1. comparison of the number of benign and malignant tumors in the dataset
2. There were 40 malignant samples that were correctly predicted, 70 benign samples, 3 benign samples that were incorrectly predicted as malignant, 1 malignant sample that was incorrectly predicted as benign.
3. High precision, recall and F1-score of 96% indicate a stable and reliable model.
